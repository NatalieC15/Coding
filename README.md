# Programming Module Assignment 
## The user manual
The assignment for the programming module (BIOL68400) was to create a software that generates a .bed file from an XML file containing LRG data of a gene of interest. 
The XML file was obtained from the [LRG website](https://www.lrg-sequence.org/index.html).
The LRG website provides stable reference sequences for all human genes in order to report variants according to reference standards. 
## Getting Started (Becca part) 

### Prerequisites (What needs to be installed to run the software and how to install them - maybe give examples?)
